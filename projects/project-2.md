It's a blog web app, made in Django framework, to share and edit writings, for the like minded people. 

Vacay is implemented using [Django](http://django.com), a Python based framework. Within three weeks, we created a website that implements a user databse which help them uniquely edit and post their writings.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MySQL](http://mysql.com) for database storage, the Django Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
